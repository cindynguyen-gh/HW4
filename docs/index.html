                            There's many lost, but tell me who has won.
                            The trench is dug within our hearts.
                            And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart.

                    <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule composed of two chains that coil 
                        around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions 
                        for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known 
                        organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids; 
                        alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), 
                        nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential 
                        for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides 
                        as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.
                    </p>

                    <p> Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases 
                        (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, 
                        and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by c
                        ovalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, 
                        resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the 
                        two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing 
                        rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. T
                        he complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. 
                        In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

                        <p>Bacterial and viral infections can cause similar symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, 
                            fever, inflammation, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and cramping -- all of which are ways 
                            the immune system tries to rid the body of infectious organisms. That said, bacterial 
                            and viral infections are dissimilar in many other important respects, most of them due 
                            to the organisms' structural differences and the way they respond to medications.
